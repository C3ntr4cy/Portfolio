            <p>3kh0 is an amazing person, and inspired me into getting into coding, and making my own websites, I used to be stuck on scratch
                but then I saw some websites, looked at how they were made, and tried to make my own. Knowing how difficult it is to make a website
                I thought, I will never be able to, but I pushed through, and here I am!
